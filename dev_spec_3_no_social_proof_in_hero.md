# No social proof in hero — dev spec
Site: allbirds.com · Priority 3 · High · Effort: Medium (2-5 days)

## Problem
The hero lacks any trust signals (reviews, ratings, or customer count), so first-time visitors may doubt the comfort claim and hesitate to click through.

## Evidence (from the live site)
> Hero H1: 'Wildly Comfortable. Super Natural.' with CTAs 'SHOP MEN' and 'SHOP WOMEN' — no review stars, no 'loved by X customers', no press logos.

## Current state
h1: Wildly Comfortable. Super Natural.; cta: SHOP MEN / SHOP WOMEN; notes: No social proof in hero section.

## Required change
h1: Wildly Comfortable. Super Natural.; cta: SHOP MEN / SHOP WOMEN; notes: Add a line under the CTAs: 'Rated 4.6/5 by 50,000+ customers' or a small strip of press logos (e.g., 'As seen in Vogue, GQ, Forbes').
